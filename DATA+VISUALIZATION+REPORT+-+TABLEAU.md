# DATA VISUALIZATION WITH TABLEAU - BASEBALL INSIGHTS
<br>
#### YOGESHWAR MURUGAN

### INTRODUCTION

The Baseball Dataset was explored and analyzed to give insights about the game. Data Visualization was done with the TABLEAU FRAMEWORK which led us to discover newer insights on performances of the players, which were never been known before. Such is the power of DATA.

**FIRST VISUALIZATION** - https://public.tableau.com/profile/yogeshwar4876#!/vizhome/Udacity-DataVisualizationwithTableau-First/Story1?publish=yes <br> **FINAL VISUALIZATION** - https://public.tableau.com/profile/yogeshwar4876#!/vizhome/Udacity-DataVisualization-DAND-Final/Story1?publish=yes

### SUMMARY

It was found during the course of making this data visualization that many relationships have been explored within the factors such as Home Runs and Height and Weight. The following patterns were identified with the help of newly created Dimensions.

I was able to conclude that, players weighing aproximatly 150 pounds and having height of 73 inches have better performance with Averages, without any effect of left or right handedness of the player.

When checking out the Statistics with Handedness in mind, it was identified that, Left-Handed Players, even though lesser in number to Right-Handed players(in this data-set), seem to perform well in the game with higher Averages and Home Runs.

### DESIGN

The first design did not much to provide deep insights with the data. It was mainly on statistics of the data, and rankings of the Home Run Scorers. It did not have much of a story to tell.

From the feedbacks received, I understood that the first design was plain and bland. I introduced some color variations to the graphs. The first sheets were not clearly depictable, hence alterations had to be done to the final. New Variable was added to dig deep into the physics of the players and how they were affecting the game.

**Sheet 1:** Bar Graph was chosen for this because it is easier to depict the number of players with each type f handedness, than it is with line or anyother types of graphs.

**Sheet 2:** Bar Graph was chosen for this sheet because it is easier to depict the number of Home Runs scored by each player. Also Color variations were added for identification of the handedness of the players.

**Sheet 3:** Scatter plot was chosen for this sheet because it is easier to identify the outlying Left-handers to prove the point that they have better averages and home runs than Right-handers.

**Sheet 4:** Histogram was chosen for this sheet for easier understanding of the height/weight ratio when compared with Average runs.

### FEEDBACK

**There were no titles for the sheets and the story:** <br>-Titles were given to the sheets and story, as it was mandatory for clear depicturing.

**Sheet 1 was not clear enough to understand:**<br>-Sheet 1 was removed for the final.

**Sheet 2 could have also had comparisons with Average:**<br>-Comparison of Handedness and Average was added to sheet 2 in final.

**Sheet 3 could have had more detailing:**<br>-Handedness Color Marks were added to the final.

**Sheet 3 is confusing:**<br>-Changed the type of the chart and introduced color variations.

**Wordings in the story were not clear**<br>-Appropriate wordings were used.

**Handedness was asked to show using full words**<br>-B,L and R were changed to their full words.
